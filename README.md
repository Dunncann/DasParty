# Das Party - #PARTYMACHEN f√ºr das Leben

A web and windows application for creating a collaborative playlist.

## It's simple
Everyone can add the tracks they like, and the others can vote if they want to listen to it. The highest voted track will be played next. One person acts as the host and plays the music from their device.

*Note: This application uses the Spotify API, so a Spotify account is needed to vote and play music.*
